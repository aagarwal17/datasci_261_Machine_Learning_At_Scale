    "We define a clear feature-selection and leakage-control policy before any heavy joins are performed. First, it distinguishes outcomes from inputs: delay outcomes are treated strictly as labels or evaluation targets, while everything that could realistically be known before departure is treated as candidate predictors. On the input side, the dataset emphasizes variables that are fixed in advance or known operationally before takeoff: calendar information that captures seasonal and weekly patterns; planned schedule details such as planned departure and arrival times and planned flight duration; and structural flight characteristics like carrier identity, route, and distance. These are complemented with “as-of” origin weather features obtained from historical observations up to a fixed cutoff time before departure, ensuring that only past or present meteorological information is used. In contrast, any field that reflects what actually happened after the aircraft began its departure sequence—such as realized delays, taxi-out times, airborne times, or ex-post cause codes—is explicitly excluded from the modeling feature set to avoid data leakage. Those variables are retained only in separate diagnostic groups for analysis and model evaluation, not as predictors. This separation between pre-event and post-event information ensures that the final feature set mirrors the information a real-time system would have at prediction time, guarding against over-optimistic performance estimates and improving the robustness of the resulting models."

    "#### iv. Airport–Weather Integration Plan (Data Joins, Issues & Rationale)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploratory review of the four source tables (flights, airport codes, weather, and station metadata) showed that the **biggest blockers are not in the flights themselves but in the lookup tables we need to join to**. The flights table already carries clean IATA airport codes (`ORIGIN`, `DEST`) and consistent date fields (`FL_DATE`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, …), so it is a good factual backbone. However, our main airport codes file does **not** include time zones and sometimes only stores geolocation as a single `coordinates` string (`\"lon, lat\"`). At the same time, the external GitHub airport list **does** provide `timezone`, and often better lat/lon, but it doesn’t perfectly align 1:1 with our current codes file. This makes a direct “flights → airports → weather” join fragile, because we would be mixing two partially-overlapping airport catalogs. To fix this, we will first build **one master airport dimension** by joining the GitHub timezones and geolocation into the codes we already use in flights, and we will coalesce coordinates so that every IATA that appears as an origin/destination ends up with: **(a)** a timezone, **(b)** a lat/lon pair, and **(c)** a human-readable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second major issue is at the **weather** side: NOAA data is hourly and station-based (`STATION`, `DATE`, 100+ weather features), not airport-based. That means there is no native key to connect “ATL, SFO, ORD…” directly to a weather row. Also, stations and airports don’t share the exact same IDs: stations use a different identifier (and sometimes we need to normalize with the `stations.csv` file). On top of that, **weather is in UTC** while our flights are in **local airport time**, so if we don’t add airport timezones first, we can’t reliably pick “the weather hour that corresponds to this departure.” To solve this, we will: (1) compute airport → nearest-(1..3)-station pairs using the unified lat/lon we just created, (2) store that in a small bridge table (`airport_weather_station`), and (3) when we enrich flights, we will convert flight times to UTC using the airport’s timezone and then pick the matching hourly weather from the correct station. This approach gives us a repeatable pattern we can scale from the 3-month sample up to 2015–2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key data problems we identified:**\n",
    "- Our original airport codes file **lacks time zones**, so flight local times cannot be aligned to UTC weather.\n",
    "- Airport geolocation is sometimes packed as a single text field (`coordinates`), so we must **parse and standardize lat/lon**.\n",
    "- Weather rows are **station-based, not airport-based**, so we must create an extra **airport → station** bridge.\n",
    "- Stations may come from **two slightly different sources** (`weather.csv` vs `stations.csv`), so we need **ID normalization**.\n",
    "- Not all flights’ origin/dest codes are guaranteed to appear in the GitHub airport list, so we will **fallback to the original codes file** to avoid losing rows."
