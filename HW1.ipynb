    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

    "# Question 3: Tokenizing\n",
    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform Word Count on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

Using the text: *\"Alice had an adventure that took alice to wonderland\"*, give a concrete example of how two different tokenizers could cause us to get two different results on this calculation. [`HINT`: _you should not need to read up on Naive Bayes to answer this question._]  \n",

    "\n",

    "* __c) code:__  Fill in the regular expression pattern in the cell labeled `part c` so that the subsequent call to `re.findall(RE_PATTERN, ...)` returns the tokenization described above.

    "# Question 6: Parallel Word Count (part 1)\n",
    "What would happen if we tried to run our script on a much larger dataset? For one thing, it would take longer to run. However there is a second concern. The Python object that aggregates our counts (`defaultdict`) exists in memory on the machine running this notebook. If the vocabulary is too large for the memory space available we would crash the notebook. The solution? Divide and Conquer! Instead of running the script on the whole dataset at once, we could split our text up in to smaller 'chunks' and process them independently of each other. __In this question you'll use a bash script to \"parallelize\" your Word Count.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) Read provided code:__ The bash script `pWordCount_v1.sh` takes an input file, splits it into a specified number of 'chunks', and then applies an executable of your choice to each chunk. Read through this code and make sure you understand each line before you proceed. [*`HINT:` For now, ignore the 'student code' section -- you'll use that in part c.*]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) Short Essay:__ Below we've provided the command to use this script to apply your analysis (`wordCount.py`) to the _Alice_ text in 4 parallel processes. We'll redirect the results into a file called `alice_pCounts.txt.` Run this analysis and compare the count for the word 'alice' to your answer from Question 4. Explain what went wrong and describe what we have to add to `pWordCount_v1.sh` to fix the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) Code in notebook:__ We've provided a python script, `aggregateCounts_v1.py`, which reads word counts from standard input and combines any duplicates it encounters. Read through this script to be sure you understand how it is written. Then follow the instructions in `pWordCount_v1.sh` to make a one-line modification so that it accepts `aggregateCounts_v1.py` as a 4th argument and uses this script to combine the chunk-ed word counts. Run the cell below to confirm that you now get the correct results for your 'alice' count."

    "# Question 7: Parallel Word Count (part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you've just implemented a Map-Reduce algorithm! From here on out, we'll refer to the two Python scripts you passed to `pWordCount_v1.sh` as '_mapper_' and '_reducer_'. The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script. Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ MapReduce uses the Merge-Sort algorithm under the hood. Linux `sort` command has a merge option which you can use to simulate the MapReduce framework. Use the `man sort` command to find more information on this option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) Multiple Choice:__ What is the potential scalability problem with the provided implementation of `aggregateCounts_v1.py`? Why would this supposedly 'parallelized' Word Count potentially not work on a really large input corpus. [*`HINT:` See the intro to Q6*]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) Code in `pWordCount_v2.sh`:__ Fortunately, a 'strategic sort' can solve this problem. Read the instructions at the top of `pWordCount_v2.sh` carefully then make your changes that alphabetically sort the output from the mappers (`countfiles`) before piping them into the reducer script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) Code in `aggregateCounts_v2.py`:__ Write the main part of `aggregateCounts_v2.py` so that it takes advantage of the sorted input to add duplicate counts without storing the whole vocabulary in memory. Refer to the file docstring for more detailed instructions. Confirm that your implementation works by running it on both the test and true data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) Short Essay:__ If you are paying close attention, this rewritten reducer sets us up for a truly scalable solution, but doesn't get us all the way there. In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) Short Essay:__ Can you come up with a different way of splitting up the data that would allow us to perform the reducing on separate machines without needing any postprocessing? This is a theoretical question -- don't worry if you don't know how to implement your idea in a bash script, just describe how you'd want to split the sorted counts into different files to be reduced separately."

    "In your reading for Week 2's live session, [Chapter1, section 2](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/MapReduce-book-final.pdf) of _Data Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce_, Lin and Dyer discuss a number of \"Big Ideas\" that underlie large scale processing: __scale \"out,\" not \"up\"; assume failures are common; move processing to the data; process data sequentially and avoid random access; hide system-level details from the application developer; and seamless scalability.__ Part of our work this semester will be to interact with these ideas in a practical way, not just a conceptual one.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) Multiple Choice:__ The mapper script below (created on the fly using a little Jupyter magic) will help us illustrate the concept of scalability. Run the provided code which passes this mapper script to our parallel computation 'framework' and runs the 'analysis' on the _Alice_ text file. Note that we've omitted a reducer for simplicity. What do you observe about the time it takes to run this \"algorithm\" when we use 1, 2 and 4 partitions? Does it meet Lin and Dyer's criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) Short Essay:__ Let's try something similar with your Word Count analysis. Run the provided code to time your implementation with 1, 2, 4 and 8 partitions. What do you observe about the runtimes? Does this match your expectation? Speculate about why we might be seeing these times. What conclusions should we draw about the scalability of our implementation? [*`HINT:` Consider the limitations of both your machine and our implementation... there are some competing forces at work, what are they?*]\n",
